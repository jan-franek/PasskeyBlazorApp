## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jan-franek/PasskeyBlazorApp.git
cd PasskeyBlazorApp
```

### **2. Restore Dependencies**

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### **3. Build the Project**

```bash
dotnet build BlazorApp.csproj -c Release -o app/build
```

### ***4. Publish the Project**

```

---

## **Configuration**

### **App Settings**

Edit the `appsettings.json` file to configure your application's settings:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "Fido2": {
    "ServerDomain": "yourdomain.com",
    "Origins": "https://yourdomain.com"
  }
}
```

- **ServerDomain**: The domain where your app is hosted.
- **Origins**: Allowed origins for FIDO2 authentication.

### **HTTPS Configuration**

Ensure that your application is set up to use HTTPS:

- Generate a self-signed certificate or use a trusted certificate.
- Update your `Program.cs` to configure Kestrel for HTTPS.

---

## **Running the Application**

You can run the application locally using the .NET CLI

```bash
dotnet run
```

---

## **Deployment**

I've deployed the live app using `Nginx`. The `Dockerfile` is currently non-functional.

## **Usage**

### **Accessing the Application**

- **Web Interface**: Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com` in your web browser.

### **User Registration**

- Go to `/register` to create a new account using FIDO2 authentication.

### **User Login**

- Go to `/login` to authenticate with your registered credentials.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. HTTPS Errors**

- Ensure that your SSL certificates are correctly installed and configured.
- Verify that the application URLs match the ones specified in `appsettings.json`.

#### **2. Database Permissions**

- Make sure the `app.db` file has the correct permissions:

  ```bash
  sudo chown www-data:www-data app.db
  sudo chmod 664 app.db
  ```

- Replace `www-data` with the user running your application.

#### **3. Origin Mismatch Errors**

- Ensure that the `Fido2:Origins` in `appsettings.json` match the domain and ports your app is running on.

#### **4. Port Conflicts**

- Confirm that the ports your application is using are not occupied by other services.
